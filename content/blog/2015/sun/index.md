When I moved to Denmark, first, I was very impressed by the long days in Summer. But later on, I was in the same way impressed by very long nights and very short days in Winter.

In one of these dark winter evenings, I wrote [a page](https://romaklimenko.github.io/sun/) to visualize how the day length changes over the year:
