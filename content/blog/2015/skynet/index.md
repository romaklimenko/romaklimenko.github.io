For the occasion of my departure from the project codename "Skynet", my colleagues prepared such an impressive cake:

This cake is a traditional Danish cake called [Kagemand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagemand) (cake man), traditionally eaten at birthdays and anniversaries.

Big thanks to my Skynet colleagues! I'll be back!
