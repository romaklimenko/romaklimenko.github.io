After eleven years in Sitecore, it's time to move on and say [hasta la vista](/2015/02/05/skynet.html).

During the last weeks, I was deeply moved to receive dozens of warm wishes from my colleagues. A few days ago, I received an electronic postcard with best wishes from more than fifty sitecorians with whom I had the pleasure to work on various projects.

My [lovely team](https://doc.sitecore.com/users/exm/100/email-experience-manager/en/introducing-the-email-experience-manager.html) presented me with a lot of cute things that I will keep to remember the time we have spent together. This funny mousepad is among these things:

It's hard to find the right words to express my gratitude to my Sitecore co-workers. I sincerely appreciate the time we were working together.

Hasta la vista, fellow sitecorians! Thank you from the bottom of my heart! ❤️
