I am very grateful to my colleagues for such a cool hoodie. Now Iâ€™m a real sitecorosaur! ðŸ¦•

My first working day in Sitecore was ten years ago, on 28 January 2010.

During the decade, I was happy to work with a lot of talented and exciting colleagues on many inspiring and challenging projects.

Here are just some of the projects I can remember:

- Support of the company's website
- Nicam demo website
- Jetstream demo website
- SitecoreÂ® Social Connected
- [SitecoreÂ® Experience Platformâ„¢](https://www.sitecore.com/products/sitecore-experience-platform) 6, 7, 8, 9
- [Testing and Optimization](https://www.sitecore.com/solutions/testing-optimization)
- [Path Analyzer](https://doc.sitecore.com/users/90/sitecore-experience-platform/en/path-analyzer.html)
- [xConnect](https://doc.sitecore.com/developers/90/sitecore-experience-platform/en/xconnect-218634.html) (the core libs, OData service, client, and providers: SQL and MongoDB)
- [SitecoreÂ® Content Hubâ„¢](https://www.sitecore.com/products/content-hub) connector
- [SitecoreÂ® Email Experience Manager](https://www.sitecore.com/products/sitecore-experience-platform/cross-channel-delivery/exm)

That was a great decade!
