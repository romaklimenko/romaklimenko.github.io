These visualizations are based on data from [d3.ru](https://d3.ru), an [online platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D3.ru) based on a rating system that allows users to appraise other individual users as well as content entries and comments posted by them.

Like reddit.com, d3.ru has a concept of karma. There are also communities with opposite political views which leads to mutual downvotes in each other's karmas.

Let's take a look at how changed karmas of all users on d3.ru:

<small>The red lines ended up with negative karma and the green lines - positive.</small>

You may notice a green mark around September 2016 - this is where users of one community organized to downvote users from the opposite community. The event was called _"karmapulta"_ _(karma + catapult)_.

Let's take a look at the downvoted community:

<small>As the mark below 0 is green, this shows how users of the downvoted community organized to upvote the downvoted users.</small>

If we leave only the most affected users who were downvoted and then upvoted during the karmapulta:
