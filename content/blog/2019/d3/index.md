To finalize the topic about [social activity visualizations](/2018/05/07/activity.html), I created a [web app](http://romaklimenko.github.io/dirty/) (in Russian) that does that interactively.

The visualizations are based on data from [d3.ru](https://d3.ru), an [online platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D3.ru) based on a rating system that allows users to appraise other individual users as well as content entries and comments posted by them.

A user can enter any username (or usernames) and see the stats.

A very active user following the daily routine:

This user doesn't follow the daily routine:

<br>
A bot:

<br>
A person that shifted from one account to another:

<br>
A person, who wrote from many accounts:

<br>
Also, it's possible to see the activity by the number of posts and comments of a particular user per day (the red columns are weekends):
