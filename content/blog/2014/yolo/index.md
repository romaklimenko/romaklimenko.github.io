When I was a young boy, I never thought about getting old:
one year seemed to be a very long time, what to say about five years!

It was hard for me to imagine finishing school, finding my first job, getting married, and having kids.

Suddenly I realized what it's already happened to me and I'm not that young boy anymore.

And my daughter is already eight, and I live with my wife for ten years, one-third of my past life.

After all these thoughts, I came to an idea to visualize events in my life. I drew a long horizontal line - my life. Under this line, I drew shorter lines for each significant period in my life:

It's nice to look at this time after time to save the feeling of where I am, where I could be and where I can be.
