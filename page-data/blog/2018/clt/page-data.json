The theorem is a key concept in probability theory because it implies that probabilistic and statistical methods that work for normal distributions can be applicable to many problems involving other types of distributions.</p>\n<p>– <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem\">Wikipedia</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To grokk this, let’s generate a sample of 1.000.000 random numbers from 0 to 100 and draw a chart where the x-axis represents a random number and the y-axis — the number of times the number occurs in our sample:</p>\n<img src=\"clt-0.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" />\n<p>Looks like more or less equally distributed.</p>\n<p>Now let’s generate another sample by using the same <code class=\"language-text\">random()</code> function, but to generate each number, we will add one random result to another: <code class=\"language-text\">random() + random()</code>:</p>\n<img src=\"clt-1.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" />\n<p>This seems like an angle, let’s add more random numbers together: <code class=\"language-text\">random() + random() + random()</code>:</p>\n<img src=\"clt-2.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" />\n<p>Let’s sum up five random numbers together:</p>\n<img src=\"clt-3.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" />","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2018/clt/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Central limit theorem","date":"June 14, 2018","tags":["statistics","probability","normal-distribution","dataisbeautiful"],"description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2018/k-means/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Dominant colors with k-means clustering"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2018/how-many-words/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How many words I learned in a year"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"640cbaa4-b863-51f1-8363-cb01deec8b0d","previousPostId":"a6bee193-b55d-5883-a658-0c64af1b981b","nextPostId":"2c468f62-4a80-53fd-ac5a-017d4a6b34a3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
