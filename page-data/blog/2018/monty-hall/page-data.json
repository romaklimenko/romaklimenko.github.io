You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The probability of winning the car after switching the choice is 2/3. This is counterintuitive for most people.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of explanations on the Internet, but I find most of them overcomplicated. It's easy to find the right answer by writing down every step what happens in both scenarios:</p>\n<p>The not-switching scenario is simple:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select one of three doors.</li>\n<li>Win with a probability of 1/3.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now let's see the always-switch-the-choice scenario:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Select one of three doors.</li>\n<li>Monty opens one of the doors with a goat.</li>\n<li>Switch the choice to another door.</li>\n<li>Win with the probability of 2/3.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the last scenario, the first step is redundant because <em>we always open another door</em>. Let's reduce it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Monty opens a door with a goat.</li>\n<li>You open one of two remaining doors (therefore you together with Monthy just opened two of three doors).</li>\n<li>Win with the probability of 2/3.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Indeed, in the second scenario, you cooperate with Monty: you and he together open two doors.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2018/monty-hall/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Monty Hall problem simply explained","date":"December 08, 2018","tags":["probability"],"description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2018/painting/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"People paint my photos!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2019/schonfinkel/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Moses Ilyich Schönfinkel"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"bb621743-3845-5e48-900c-ad34fcb5d520","previousPostId":"a82c33f2-b4d5-5fc4-8338-fe96d47cf8e3","nextPostId":"2600b6b7-96a0-5e69-a375-1c6aa1f4d7ce"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
