Every day, without any holidays or pauses, I learned new Danish words.</p>\n<p>To do so, I wrote a single app that randomly shows me a Danish word, I need to call to memory what does the word mean:</p>\n<img src=\"derudenfor.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" />\n<p>And then I open a description and check if I correctly remember the meaning of the word:</p>\n<img src=\"derudenfor-2.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" />\n<p>If I was right, the word is postponed to be repeated in several days. The more times I guess the meaning, the longer interval to the next repetition. I use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number\">Fibonacci numbers</a> to figure out the next date.</p>\n<p>If I forgot the meaning, I reset the number of successful repetitions and the word shall be repeated later today.</p>\n<p>This technique is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition\">spaced repetition</a>. The most popular algorithm in this area is <a href=\"https://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm\">SM2</a> from early <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo\">SuperMemo</a>. The SM2 implementation looks very similar to the Fibonacci numbers, so for my purposes, I just held to the latest option.</p>\n<p>I also limited the number of the repetitions to 10, so the word after 10th successful repetition is considered as learned and never appears again. With Fibonacci numbers, a word gets its 10th repetition on the 143rd day after the first one:</p>\n<img src=\"excel.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" />\n<p>And so here I am:</p>\n<p>A dictionary that I use contains 94.137 Danish words.</p>\n<p>In a year, I have seen 3.881 words and learned 2.556 of them.</p>\n<p>Here is how my learning went. The top edge of the red area is seen words and the bottom edge is the learned ones:</p>\n<img src=\"progress.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" />\n<p>Here is how the amount of the “working set” (seen — learned) has changed over time:</p>\n<img src=\"working-set.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" />\n<p>This is how the numbers of repetitions are distributed over all the words in my database:</p>\n<img src=\"repetitions.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" />\n<p>And here is how many words are scheduled for each day now. The greener, the lesser is the average number of successful repetitions on each word on that day:</p>\n<img src=\"forecast.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" />\n<p>On the next step, I plan to take words popularity into account, so the popular words would appear with higher probability.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2018/how-many-words/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How many words I learned in a year","date":"September 09, 2018","tags":["danish","spaced-repetition","pet-project","dataisbeautiful"],"description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2018/clt/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Central limit theorem"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2018/painting/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"People paint my photos!"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2c468f62-4a80-53fd-ac5a-017d4a6b34a3","previousPostId":"640cbaa4-b863-51f1-8363-cb01deec8b0d","nextPostId":"a82c33f2-b4d5-5fc4-8338-fe96d47cf8e3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
