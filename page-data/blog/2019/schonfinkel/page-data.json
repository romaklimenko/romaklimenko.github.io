Curry always insisted that he got the idea of using h from M. Schönfinkel’s, but most workers seem to prefer to pronounce ‘<strong>currying</strong>’ rather than ‘<strong>schönfinkeling</strong>’\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Moses Ilyich Schönfinkel was born in 1889 in Ekaterinoslav (also my hometown, renamed in 1926 to Dnepropetrovsk and renamed in 2016 to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnipro\">Dnipro</a>).</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Sch%C3%B6nfinkel\">Wikipedia</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Schönfinkel developed a formal system that avoided the use of bound variables. His system was essentially equivalent to a combinatory logic based upon the combinators <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>I</strong>, <strong>K</strong>, and <strong>S</strong>. Schönfinkel was able to show that the system could be reduced to just <strong>K</strong> and <strong>S</strong> and outlined a proof that a version of this system had the same power as predicate logic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Schönfinkel attended the Novorossiysk University of Odessa, studying mathematics under Samuil Osipovich Shatunovskii, who worked in geometry and the foundations of mathematics. From 1914 to 1924, Schönfinkel was a member of David Hilbert's group at the University of Göttingen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After he left Göttingen, Schönfinkel returned to Moscow. By 1927 he was reported to be mentally ill and in a sanatorium. <strong>His later life was spent in poverty, and he died in Moscow some time in 1942. His papers were burned by his neighbors for heating</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is very little information on the Schönfinkel's biography on the Internet. A quick fact checking shows that the phrase about Schönfinkel's papers burned by his neighbors is linked to a <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-symbolic-logic/article/s-a-anovskaa-osnovania-matematiki-i-matematiceskaa-logika-foundations-of-mathematics-and-mathematical-logic-matematika-v-sssr-za-tridcat-let-19171947-mathematics-in-the-ussr-for-the-thirty-years-19171947-ogiz-moscow-and-leningrad1948-pp-950/1354C8597C3BEAAE82836127B2953AA1\">review</a> Yanovskaya's article. I have read the review carefully and found only this (<em>see the last sentence</em>):</p>\n<img src=\"1550946356-ce7f5e8dd50cd32f9ac728d0698d288d.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" />\n<p>Again:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The author gives the biographical information that Shönfinkel became mentally ill and died in Moscow in 1942.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let's look into the original article (<em>in Russian</em>):</p>\n<img src=\"1550946822-2d16ee4b76b2ab374e335b9ce1d5ea26.png\" class=\"img-fluid\" />\n<blockquote>\n<p>Этот блестящий ученик Шатуновского, к сожалению, рано выбыл из строя. (Заболев душевно, Шейнфинкель умер в Москве в 1942 г.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In English:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This brilliant student of Shatunovsky, unfortunately, early out of action. (Mentally ill, Scheinfinkel died in Moscow in 1942).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is all about Schönfinkel's last years in the article.</p>\n<p>Another source that I found is a bit odd.
